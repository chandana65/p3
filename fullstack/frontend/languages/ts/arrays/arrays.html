    An array is a homogenous collection of values.
    <br>An array is a special type of data type which can store multiple values of different data types sequentially using a special syntax.

    <br> TypeScript supports arrays, similar to JavaScript. There are two ways to declare an array: <br>
    
    1. Using square brackets. This method is similar to how you would declare arrays in JavaScript. <br>
    
    let fruits: string[] = ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana']; <br>
    
    2. Using a generic array type, Array<elementType>. <br>
    
    let fruits: Array<string> = ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana']; <br>
    
    Both methods produce the same output. <br>
    
  <br>  Of course, you can always initialize an array like shown below, but you will not get the advantage of TypeScript's type system.
    
    let arr = [1, 3, 'Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana', true, false]; <br>
    
    Arrays can contain elements of any data type, numbers, strings, or even objects. <br>
    
    Arrays can be declared and initialized separately.
