    FETCH
  </h1></center>
  <br><br>Using node-fetch with TypeScript is a powerful way to make HTTP requests in your application. 
  <br> With the ability to add options to requests and use async/await, <br> node-fetch offers a lot of flexibility for making HTTP requests
  <br>The global fetch() method starts the process of fetching a resource from the network, <br>
   returning a promise that is fulfilled once the response is available.  <br>
  The promise resolves to the Response object representing the response to your request.
