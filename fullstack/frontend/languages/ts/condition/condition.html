    <center><h1>CONDITION</h1></center>
    <br> <br>
    Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run. There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including: “If” statements: <br> where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.
    <br>
    The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), <br> then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), <br>
     and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.
